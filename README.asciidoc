= Paletti

image::Paletti.gif[]

Paletti creates a color palette of an image.
It _quantizes_ the image using http://leptonica.org[Leptonica], and then creates a color palette out of the remaining colors.
Click on a color to copy its hex value into the clipboard.
You can also save or export the image separately.

This is a JavaFX version of https://github.com/Eroica/Paletti[Paletti (Vala)] written for Windows.
It is styled to look like a native (UWP) Windows app.

== Installation

A Windows executable is available under Releases.
It is created using `jpackage` which bundles the necessary JRE, so nothing else is required to run Paletti.

Since this version of Paletti is written in JavaFX, it should theoretically run on GNU/Linux and macOS as well.
However, I didn't intend to support macOS with this program.
It is written for Windows.
For GNU/Linux, please use the feature-identical version written in Vala and GTK https://github.com/Eroica/Paletti[here].
